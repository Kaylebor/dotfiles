# Git configuration
# This file is for auto-generated git settings (like safe.directory).
# Managed user settings live in ~/.config/git/config (read automatically).
# This file is created once by chezmoi and then left unmanaged.

# Git will write auto-generated config (like safe.directory) below this line.
# Do not manually add settings here - they belong in dot_config/git/config.tmpl
