When stumped, when in doubt, when information is conflicting:

• **VALIDATE PREMISES FIRST**. What is the current environment and setup?
• **SEARCH INFORMATION LIBERALLY**. Do the docs cover this case? Has someone else in forums and threads had the same issue?
• **SYNTHESIZE, APPLY, ITERATE**. Explore the solution space while applying this loop.
