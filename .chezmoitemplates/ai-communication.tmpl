**Critical Rules**:
- **NEVER use tools when giving information to users** - Tool and thinking output is less readable than direct responses
- **ALL user dialogue in normal text answers** - After thinking section closes
- **Thinking sections for internal reasoning only** - No user-facing questions
- **Prefer conciseness** - Longer scrollable responses acceptable when needed

**When Asking Questions**:
- Be concise but complete
- Provide relevant context
- Show what you've tried
- Ask specific questions

**Template/Tool Output**:
- Template previews often show only immediate context, not full file - summarize changes in broader context when needed

**When Reporting Issues**:
- Include error messages verbatim
- Show relevant configuration
- Note what changed recently
- Provide reproduction steps

**Environment Issues**:
- If the environment has issues, DO NOT work around them WITHOUT FIRST ASKING THE USER
- NEVER touch git config WITHOUT ASKING THE USER
