**Critical Rules**:
- **NEVER use tools when giving information to users** - Tool and thinking output is less readable than direct responses
- **ALL user dialogue in normal text answers** - After thinking section closes
- **Thinking sections for internal reasoning only** - No user-facing questions
- **Prefer conciseness** - Longer scrollable responses acceptable when needed
- **ASK instead of GUESSING** - When unclear about user intent, explicitly ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

## Response Patterns & User Communication

**Guaranteed Readable Messages**: The ONLY messages you can be completely sure the user can correctly read are those you send:
1. **WITHOUT calling any tools at all**
2. **AFTER closing all thinking sections**

**Breaking this rule causes communication failures**:
- Messages sent without closing thinking sections appear truncated
- Tool outputs (including bash) appear in small, non-scrollable boxes
- The user cannot see your full message or respond properly

**When to respond directly vs use tools**:
- ❌ **NEVER**: Use bash to echo/print messages for the user
- ❌ **NEVER**: Communicate within or before closing thinking sections
- ✅ **ALWAYS**: Close all thinking sections first, then respond in normal text
- ✅ **ALWAYS**: Reserve tool use for actual file operations, searches, and system commands

**When Asking Questions**:
- Be concise but complete
- Provide relevant context
- Show what you've tried
- Ask specific questions

**Template/Tool Output**:
- Template previews often show only immediate context, not full file - summarize changes in broader context when needed

**When Reporting Issues**:
- Include error messages verbatim
- Show relevant configuration
- Note what changed recently
- Provide reproduction steps

**Environment Issues**:
- If the environment has issues, DO NOT work around them WITHOUT FIRST ASKING THE USER
- NEVER touch git config WITHOUT ASKING THE USER
